## Description
Creating Readme files from scratch can become boring and time consuming so I created an application that allows users to generate one by responding to prompts.

## Installation
Run the application in the terminal by navigating to the correct directory and entering the following command: node index.js 

## Technologies used
* Npm Inquirer
* JavaScript
* NodeJs

## Usage
After running the application you will be prompted with questions related to each section in the readme. Once all of the prompts have been responded to the readme will generate.
